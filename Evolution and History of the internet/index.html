                        began to increase their technological capabilities to gain an advantage in the war. Computers 
                        were extremely big and expensive and could not communicate over long distances. This was 
                        essential for researchers to share valuable information. Internet development began in the 
                        1960s when the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was established. 
                        Their team designed packet switching technology which is a crucial element for the design and 
                        creation for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) in the 1970s.

                    <p class="excerpt">The internet has experienced many changes along the years to aid the development and 
                        accessibility of the platform. In the early phases of the internet known as the Syntactic Web 
                        which enabled very basic communication and information display which could only be seen by 
                        its visual presentation. As a new digital era took place the Semantic Web was born which used 
                        the Syntactic web as a building block to aid its advancements. Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of 
                        the World Wide Web envisioned the Semantic web as an advanced user experience were 
                        machines understood the relations between data and not only display the information but 
                        process it using Technologies like RDF (Resource Description Framework). Further the 
                        Pragmatic web was born to understand user preferences, behaviours and intentions thus 
                        enabling personalized content delivery and interactions allowing a tailored experience to the 
                        user while being as efficient as possible. As technology progresses the complexity of these 
                        platforms will increase as well allowing a more efficient and tailored experience.</p>

                    <p class="excerpt">In the 1960's, the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), was given a grant by U.S 
                        defence to start researching into developing a network.
                        The goal was to develop protocols to allow computers to interconnect with each other 
                        regardless of the geographical area.
                        The first successful network was created and was mainly used for academic and scientific 
                        research purposes on campuses.
                        Down the road, a problem occurred- People using these different networks needed to 
                        connect to each other.
                        In order to successfully interconnect, the networks needed to use the exact same protocols.
                        These problems led to the invention of a global, unique- suit of protocols- called the<i>TCP/IP 
                        suit.</i> 
                        To take advantage of this huge network, and make use of it, many internet services have 
                        been engineered and created.</p>
