    <div class="introArch">
    <p id="introPArch">To understand web applications, it is imperative to know that there are endless amounts of data
        packets sent and received between clients and servers. An example of a client is a computer,
        and a server is a cluster of computers or single computer that uses the HTTP protocol to send
        information.</p>

    <div id="Comp3Arch">Web application structure is made of 3 main components</div>
        <h3 id="presentationHArch">Presentation</h3>
        <h3 id="logicHArch">Logic</h3>
        <h3 id="dataHArch">Data</h3>
        
        <p class="PresentationPArch">
        Presentation provides a user interface to display all information using colours, pictures
        etc. 
        </p>
        <p class="LogicPArch">
        The Logic can be seen as the brain of the application at it governs what happens when
        certain conditions are met. 
        </p>
        <p class="DataPArch">
        Lastly the data is the information stored on the webpage. These 3
        components work interconnected to provide a seamless user experience.

    <p id="mainPArch">
        These 3 components work interconnected to provide a seamless user experience. There are a multitude
        of web applications such as Monolithic applications and all-in-one applications. Monolithic
        applications are self-contained and rarely interact with other services such as external
        databases. All the application behaviours run inside its own process and to scale such an
        application horizontally the entire process is duplicated to multiple servers. All in one application
        stores every component in one project such as the presentation, logic and data discussed
        previously. All in one applications are compiled to a single assembly, single project and single
        unit. Applications also contain many different layers divided into different levels of complexity
        and aid developers to find certain functionality if needed. If an application is coded with different
        layers, low level layers can be reused to save time and minimize the amount of time spent
        coding. Layers also help with encapsulation since restrictions can be set in place on layer
        communication to ensure integrity if a layer was removed.
