            <b>The Origins of the World Wide Web</b> <br>
            The World Wide Web, often referred to as the Web, is a vast and interconnected network of digital information accessible through the internet. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s, it allows users to navigate and interact with multimedia content, including text, images, videos, and more, using hyperlinks. Users access web pages through web browsers, which interpret HTML code to display content. The Web has transformed how people communicate, collaborate, and access information on a global scale. It's a foundational element of the modern digital age, facilitating everything from online shopping and social networking to research and education.

            <b>History Of The Internet</b> <br>
            During the cold war between the Soviet Union and the United States a race between counties began to increase their technological capabilities to gain an advantage in the war. Computers were extremely big and expensive and could not communicate over long distances. This was essential for researchers to share valuable information.  Internet development began in the 1960s when the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was established. Their team designed packet switching technology which is a crucial element for the design and creation for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) in the 1970s.

            <b>World Wide Web VS The Internet</b> <br>
            Understanding the difference between the internet and the world wide web is of utmost importance. The internet can be seen as a global network using TCP/IP to facilitate data transfer between billions of devices and servers while the web is a subset of the internet consisting of a friendly user interface known as a browser such as google, and online content mostly coded in HTML to aid in the navigation of the internet. Both the internet and the world wide web live in a symbiotic relationship since both are their own entity but function as intended when working together.
